# Fork of Shift by Siempo


Shift is a browser extension that gives you a nudge when you spend too much time on distracting websites, and provides a new tab with an intention, to help you focus on what matters.

This fork removes the option to hide nudges and makes sliders harder to... slide. Otherwise, it's just the same.

To install, you need to enable Developer mode on Chrome and then drag the project's directory to your extensions page.

How does it work?
------------
Spend more than two minutes on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter, and a notification will pop up, reminding you of your intention for the day.
